# Online Cookbook - Mile Stone Project III

This Mile Stone Project was created and based on CRUD principals.
A fully resposive web app where the user can access a variety of recipes such as pasta for exemple.
The recipes can be Created, Edited and Deleted by the user. 
As the web app is a Project and its based on CRUD only. I have decided not to add a login and more then a search box 
to have my code clean and readible into CRUD backend.

## UX

This web site was designed to be totally simple to the user interact with. 
It is fully-responsive and suitble to all devices sizes.

- When the user enter the page can view a navbar with the "Logo", Search Box, Add Recipe and Home.
  The main page content it is responsible to display all recipes added. Also display the results of the search box.

- The search box will display all results that finds and display them into index page content.
  ex: search pasta will display all results that contain pasta.

- After the user click the Add Recipe, it will display input fields to be filled as Recipe Details, Ingredients and Cook Method.
  It is simple steps to fill in and by the end of the page the user can press the Add button to add your recipe to the page.

- When click on the home button the user will be redicrect to the index page.

- In the main content page where the recipes are diplayed the user can click on the Recipe Details and it will open only that specific recipe
  on the page with all the recipe details, Ingredients and Cook Method.
  On the botton the user can see a Delete Recipe button. That when pressed delete that specific recipe.
  Also the user can see a Edit Recipe Button. When pressed it will display a page with all the recipe information filled in such as
  Details, Ingredients and Cook Method to be Edited.

## Testing

As tester, i have test all functionality stating on navbar all links and search box works property as programmed.
On the content page everything goes right, the cards distribution wich comes automatic with the for loop work really well.
The Add Recipe and Edit Recipe link and all the fields can be completed without a problem i have only required the URL field as probably
i will be the only one to insert, update and delete data from the web app.
The delete button also works if pressed remove specific data from the specific card you are deleting.
